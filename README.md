# Example App: Podcast Library

## Purpose of this project

This is a simple app that allows users to browse the iTunes podcast directory. Future versions will allow users to subscribe to podcast channels and save episodes to a "Listen Later" list. I've created it with a couple priorities in mind:

- **Accessibility**: This app should follow all web accessibility best practices, including sufficient color contrast, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and appropriate ARIA roles and attributes.
- **Full-stack JavaScript**: This app demonstrates one way of writing a full-stack JavaScript application. It includes a GraphQL API endpoint built on top of Node.js and Express, server side-rendered React with Next.js, and authentication via an integration with Auth0.
- **GitHub workflow**: Besides a few commits to get the repo bootstrapped, I will use issues and pull requests to record bugs, features, and other significant changes to the code.

## What this project is not

- **An end-user product**: The primary goal of this project is not to fulfill the needs of real users. Although it should certainly be a functional application, it does not aim to address a market niche, grow a user base, or anything of that sort. The primary goal is to demonstrate the priorities listed in the previous section.
- **A well-researched design**: I am using the default Tailwind CSS settings in this project to create an attractive and usable design quickly.No UX research or user testing is informing the design decisions made here.
- **An example of robust browser testing or compatibility**: I would love to make this app compatible with a wide range of browsers, but I don't have the time or resources to do that with this project.
